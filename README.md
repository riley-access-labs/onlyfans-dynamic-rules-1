# Dynamic rules to make OnlyFans API requests

This repo provides free and public access to the rules that are required to make any authenticated requests to OnlyFans' official API. Because these rules are a security feature, they change quite frequently. Sometimes once every few days, sometimes multiple times in a day.

The rules are posted here some time after they have been updated and published for supporters of the OFAuth project.
